# Python Codes

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates my approach to problem
solving, iterative development, and writing clear, maintainable logic.
The primary project in this repository is a **Blackjack game implementation**
that is **actively under development**.

This repository reflects real-world coding practices: building incrementally,
testing logic, refactoring, and using version control to track progress.

## 🃏 Current Project: Blackjack (In Progress)

The Blackjack project is a work in progress and is being developed iteratively.
Commits represent logical milestones rather than a finalized product.

Current focus areas include:
- Core game logic and flow
- Player and dealer decision handling
- Win / loss / push evaluation
- Clean separation of responsibilities between functions
- Improving readability and structure as features are added

The intent is to demonstrate **reasoning, control flow, and incremental problem
solving**, rather than a polished UI or final game state.

## 🔧 What This Repository Demonstrates

- Python fundamentals (functions, conditionals, loops, data structures)
- Translating rules and requirements into executable logic
- Iterative development and refactoring
- Debugging and reasoning through edge cases
- Cross-platform development (Windows & macOS)
- Version control with Git and GitHub
